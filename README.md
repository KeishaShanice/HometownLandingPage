How It's Made:
Technologies used include HTML, CSS
I started with building the framework in HTML. It was a simple build. The bulk of my time was taken on the CSS. 

Optimizations:
In addition to the project requirements, I added navigational links and a hover effect that changes the color of certain words

Lessons Learned:
With this project, I was able to become more comfortable with flex box.
