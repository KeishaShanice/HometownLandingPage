<h2>How It's Made:</h2>
<p>Technologies used include HTML, CSS</p>
<p>I started with building the framework in HTML. It was a simple build. The bulk of my time was taken on the CSS. </p>

<h2>Optimizations:</h2>
<p>In addition to the project requirements, I added navigational links and a hover effect that changes the color of certain words</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>With this project, I was able to become more comfortable with flex box.</p>
